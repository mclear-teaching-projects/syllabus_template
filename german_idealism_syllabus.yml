# Front matter
title: 'Classical German Idealism'

quote: 
- content: '[I]t is not difficult to see that our own epoch is a time of birth and a transition to a new period. Spirit has broken with the previous world of its existence and its ways of thinking; it is now of a mind to let them recede into the past and to immerse itself in its own work at reshaping itself.'
  title: '*Phenomenology of Sprit*'
  author: 'G.W.F. Hegel'

# Sections
overview: |
  A survey of "Classical" German Idealism, starting with Kant's publication of the
  *Critique of Pure Reason* in 1781 and concluding with the first part of Hegel's
  *Science of Logic* in 1812. Figures discussed include Kant, Jacobi, Reinhold,
  Schulze, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The general theme of the course concerns the
  question, "How is inquiry into the nature of reality---i.e.
  metaphysics---possible?". In asking this question we focus on four lines of thought
  prominent in German Idealism—viz. Spinozism, skepticism, self-consciousness, and
  the relationship between the senses and the intellect.

objectives:
  - In completing this course students will (i) gain a basic grasp of the views of
    Immanuel Kant and his immediate German Idealist successors; (ii) learn how Kant's
    thought was received in Germany into the early 19th century; (iii) understand the
    formation and early developemnt of the various views that are typically grouped
    under the moniker of post-Kantian "German Idealism".

  masks: |
    As of July 17, 2020 and until further notice, all University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL) faculty, staff, students, and visitors (including contractors, service providers, and others) are required to use a facial covering at all times when indoors except under specific conditions outlined in the COVID-19 face covering policy found at: [https://covid19.unl.edu/face-covering-policy](https://covid19.unl.edu/face-covering-policy). This statement is meant to clarify classroom policies for face coverings:

    To protect the health and well-being of the University and wider community, UNL has implemented a policy requiring all people, including students, faculty, and staff, to wear a face covering that covers the mouth and nose while on campus. The classroom is a community, and as a community, we seek to maintain the health and safety of all members by wearing face coverings when in the classroom. Failure to comply with this policy is interpreted as a disruption of the classroom and may be a violation of UNL’s Student Code of Conduct.

    Individuals who have health or medical reasons for not wearing face coverings should work with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (for students) or the Office of Faculty/Staff Disability Services (for faculty and staff) to establish accommodations to address the health concern. Students who prefer not to wear a face covering should work with their advisor to arrange a fully online course schedule that does not require their presence on campus.

    Students in the classroom:

      1. If a student is not properly wearing a face covering, the instructor will remind the student of the policy and ask them to comply with it.
      2. If the student will not comply with the face covering policy, the instructor will ask the student to leave the classroom, and the student may only return when they are properly wearing a face covering.
      3. If the student refuses to properly wear a face covering or leave the classroom, the instructor will dismiss the class and will report the student to Student Conduct & Community Standards for misconduct, where the student will be subject to disciplinary action.

    Instructors in the classroom:

      1. If an instructor is not properly wearing a face covering, students will remind the instructor of the policy and ask them to comply with it.
      2. If an instructor will not properly wear a face covering, students may leave the classroom and should report the misconduct to the department chair or via the TIPS system for disciplinary action through faculty governance processes.
  misc: 'Please turn off cell phones, beeping watches, and other gadgets that make noise before entering or beginning class. Absolutely no texting is permitted during class. I will subtract up to five points from your participation grade each and every time your phone rings or I see you texting during class.'
resources:
- jargon: 'It’s important to be on top of the technical terms used by philoso- phers. Please ask for clarification of terms in class. You can also consult Jim Pryor’s online “Philosophical Terms and Methods.”'
  help: |
    Papers should adhere to some consistent practice of footnoting and citation (Chicago, MLA, etc.). I don’t really mind which one you use as long as you are consistent. On writing a philosophy paper, there is no better on-line guide than Jim Pryor’s. Please [consult it](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html). Hacker’s [A Writer’s Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Reference-Diana-Hacker-dp-1319057446/dp/1319057446/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) is also extremely helpful. Useful online writing help may be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab at [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/).

    The UNL Writing Center can provide you with meaningful support as you write for this class as well as every course in which you enroll.
